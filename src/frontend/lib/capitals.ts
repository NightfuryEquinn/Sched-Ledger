/*
 * Capitals money math — every figure is derived, nothing is persisted.
 *
 * A plan has a budget (B), payments recorded on its line items (P), and a pot of
 * savings deposits assigned to it (S). Line items carry no funding source, so
 * Capitals assumes payments are drawn from the pot first and from other money
 * only once the pot is empty:
 *
 *   saved       S = deposits − withdrawals carrying this plan's id
 *   unspent     max(0, S − P)              what is still in the pot
 *   ofPocket    max(0, P − S)              payments the pot did not cover
 *   outstanding max(0, B − P)              budgeted cost not yet paid
 *   need        max(0, outstanding − unspent)
 *
 * `need` collapses to (B − S) while the pot still covers every payment, and to
 * (B − P) once payments have emptied it, so money that was set aside and then
 * spent on an item is only ever counted once. The old formula was
 * (B − P − S), which counted it twice and under-stated what was left to save.
 *
 * The draw-down is implicit: paying an item is NOT recorded as an assigned
 * withdrawal, and must not be, or the pot would be drawn down twice — once by
 * the withdrawal and once by the payment. See `logCapitalItem` in LedgerApp.
