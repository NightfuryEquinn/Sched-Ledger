              Sched Ledger is a private expense ledger and schedule app. You sign in with a Web3 wallet identity.
              We do not require an email or password. You are responsible for safeguarding your wallet keys and recovery phrase.
              Prefer creating a ledger-only identity in the app rather than reconnecting a funded exchange or hot wallet, so the
              login address is less likely to be correlated with on-chain activity.
